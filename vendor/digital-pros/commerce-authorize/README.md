# Authorize.net AIM - Craft Commerce 2 Gateway

## Installing the Gateway

This gateway utilizes the thephpleague/omnipay-authorizenet Authorize.net driver, and will update the Authorize.net AIM gateway in Craft Commerce 1.

#### Requirements
- Craft 3 (or later)
- Craft Commerce 2

This gateway is a commercial plugin for Craft 3 and can be installed using the Craft plugin store, or by updating the composer.json file to require this gateway.

```composer require digital-pros/commerce-authorize ```

## Using the Gateway

After installing the gateway, the default form fields will submit a transaction to Authorize.net.

### Default Payment Form

When enabled in the Gateway settings, the default payment form will be used. When additional customization is needed, the custom forms below should be used. When this toggle is enabled, the following line of code will render the payment form.

    {{ cart.gateway.getPaymentFormHtml({}) }}

### Custom Payment Form
***The examples below have been simplified for illustration purposes.***

	<label>Card Holder</label>
	<input name="firstName" placeholder="First Name" required="required" type="text">
	<input name="lastName" placeholder="Last Name" required="required" type="text">

	<label>Card Number</label>
	<input id="number" name="number" placeholder="Card Number" required="required" type="text">

	<label>Card Expiration Date</label>
	<select id="month" name="month"><option value="12">12</option>...</select>
	<select id="year" name="year"><option value="2019">2019</option>...</select>

	<label>CVV/CVV2</label>
	<input id="cvv" name="cvv" placeholder="CVV" required="required" type="text">

	{{ cart.gateway.getPaymentFormHtml({})|raw }}

	<button id="submit" name="submit">Pay Now</button>

## Accept.js

If Accept.js is enabled in the plugin settings, the gateway will require two hidden fields (`token` and `tokenDescriptor`), which are sent back to Authorize.net after the card is validated. Accept.js also requires an adjustment to the submit button so that the payment form only submits after the card has been validated by Accept.js. As long as the two hidden fields are defined and filled by Accept.js, the credit card details will not be required.

If `sendPaymentDataToAnet()` contains a `true` parameter, `sendPaymentDataToAnet(true)` the card data will be removed from the credit card fields after the token has been created, but before the form is submitted to the server for processing. For the default form above, this option is specified in the gateway settings.

    <label>Card Holder</label>
	<input name="firstName" placeholder="First Name" required="required" type="text">
	<input name="lastName" placeholder="Last Name" required="required" type="text">

	<label>Card Number</label>
	<input id="number" name="number" placeholder="Card Number" required="required" type="text">

	<label>Card Expiration Date</label>
	<select id="month" name="month"><option value="12">12</option>...</select>
	<select id="year" name="year"><option value="2019">2019</option>...</select>

	<label>CVV/CVV2</label>
	<input id="cvv" name="cvv" placeholder="CVV" required="required" type="text">

	<!-- Required fields and changes for Authorize.net Accept.js -->

	<input id="token" name="token" type="hidden">
	<input id="tokenDescriptor" name="tokenDescriptor" type="hidden">

	{{ cart.gateway.getPaymentFormHtml({})|raw }}

	<button id="authorizeSubmit" name="authorizeSubmit" onclick="event.preventDefault(); sendPaymentDataToAnet(true);">Pay Now</button>
